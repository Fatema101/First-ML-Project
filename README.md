The project involves using a Linear Regression model to predict outcomes based on real-world data.

   The goal of this project was to:
1. Explore data cleaning and preparation.
2. Train a Linear Regression model.
3. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
4. Gain hands-on experience with tools like Google Colab, pandas, and scikit-learn.

   Tools and Libraries: 
1. Google Colab: For coding and execution.
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
4. seaborn : For data visualization.
